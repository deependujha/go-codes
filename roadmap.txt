For Concurrency, you’ll want to cover key topics such as:

Goroutines (the foundation of concurrency in Go).
Channels (used for communication between goroutines).
Worker Pools (to manage concurrency efficiently).
Mutexes and sync primitives (for managing shared state).
Select Statement (for multi-channel operations).
For Intermediate topics, you can focus on:

Error Handling (a key part of Go’s design philosophy).
Generics (with the new syntax in Go 1.18+).
Templates (text/template and html/template).
Testing (unit tests, table-driven tests).
Reflection (for more advanced type manipulation).

Standard Library
net/http, crypto, encoding, os, etc., you'll be ready to dive into projects that make use of them.
